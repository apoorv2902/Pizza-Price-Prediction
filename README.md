# Pizza price prediction
This project is to predict the price of pizza. First I performed exploratory data analysis then I used decision tree, random forest and XGboost regressor for model fitting. For accuracy of the model R^2 score was calculated.

## Library used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn
6. xgboost

## Accuracy of models:
| Model         | R2 Score      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Decision Tree | 98.76         |
| Random Forest | 94.56         |
| XG-Boost      | 95.72         |
